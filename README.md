You can implement a separate component or background task that checks the medication schedule and sends reminders to the user, either through a mobile app notification, email, or SMS. This component will periodically check the medication schedule and send reminders based on the scheduled times.

This code demonstrates the basic CRUD operations for medication management. You will need to set up the corresponding repository, configure the database connection in your Spring Boot application properties, and handle reminders and notifications using additional components or services.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you may need to add more features, such as authentication and security, user profiles, and more advanced reminder logic. Additionally, you should ensure that you follow all legal and ethical requirements when handling sensitive health data.
